# Quick start
## Product Description
A running robot for beginners as well as experienced developers: With the "Hexapod Robobug" complete set, consisting of electronics, mechanics and digital high-performance servos, you can build your own Hexapod running robot and enter the exciting world of robotics! The	"Hexapod	Robobug"	complete	set	is	the	ideal	basis	for	entering	the	fields	of	electronics,	mechanics	and	programming:	it	enables	a	large	number	of	extensions by using additional user boards such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi or NodeMCU and offers space for many additional components. The robot is designed in such a way that it can be controlled without programming using the controller supplied, similar to an RC model. Thanks to its expandability	and	flexibility,	the	robot	is	perfect	for	hobby,	research,	schools,	education	and	training	and	encourages	independent	development	and	expansion.

 (*) Not included in the delivery: The 3D print data of the Pan & Tilt unit and the required components can be found on the product's website. The product also requires a rechargeable battery and a suitable charger.
