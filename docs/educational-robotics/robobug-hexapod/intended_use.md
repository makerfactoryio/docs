The "Hexapod Robobug" complete set is solely designed for training, research and private use in the hobby or model construction area and the operating times associated with it. 

The product is not a toy and should be kept out of reach of children under 14 years of age. 

The product is aimed at advanced users who already have experience with Arduino and the programming language C/C ++ and also in electronics as well as in the construction of mechanical kits. The product must not get damp or wet! The electronics are designed for operation at an ambient temperature between 0 °C and +40 °C.

Mechanical components as well as servo motors are subject to natural wear and can wear during long operating times. The servos can be reordered as spare parts. The servo motors have a high cycle stability of up to 100,000 cycles. However, the Robobug is not designed to carry out permanent movements. The motors in the servo require a break of at least 10 minutes after a longer run (about 10 minutes of continuous movement) in order to cool down. This ensures a long service life. 

If you use the product for other purposes than those described above, the product may be damaged. Moreover, improper use involves risks such as shortcircuits, fire, electric shocks, etc. Please read the operating instructions carefully and do not discard them. Please include these operating instructions when you pass the product on to a third party.
