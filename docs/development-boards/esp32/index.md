# Documentation for the Embedded Board Builder for ESP32

This documentation describes ESP32 Evalulation board as part of the Embedded Board Builder (EBB) familiy from Makerfactory. This board is an an devleopment board for the ESP32 module from Expressif. With this development board you could develop projects for the **ESP32-WROOM** or **ESP32-WROVER**.

## Peripheral components

The EBB for ESP32 comes with a bunch of peripheral components which could be used for own projects. The usage of these component is described in this document. The follwing table lists the components:

!!! hint
    The ESP32 module has a **limited** number of usable IO ports. It's **not possible** to use all components on the board to the same time. Therefore you have to decide which component on the evaluation board you want to use in your project. In order to use a component you have you switch the appropriate dip switches to on. Additionally you have to switch conflicting components to off. The components which are using the same IO are described in the component pages.
